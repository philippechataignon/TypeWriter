# Typewriter Arduino project

## Introduction

The project aims to transform a Panasonic KX-R191 electronic typewriter into a
printer, i.e.  make possible to control it from a computer.

For simplicity reason, printing is done via serial over USB on the arduino.

Arduino code handles the control of the typewriter, and `print.py` is a small
python program to prepare for printing and sending correct data over the serial
line.

## Hack description

The typewriter is an old Panasonic KX-R191, you can see photos and information
on https://typewriterdatabase.com/198x-panasonic-kxr191.2355.typewriter.

These models have an external ports to act as a printer but you need an
external converter (a Panasonic KX-R60) that is now unobtainable. And even with
the converter, it still need a LPT1 connector, with correct drivers, so very
little chance to work.

On the circuit board of the typewriter, we can find some microcontroller and
other components, but nothing easy to understand without schematics and code.

So I decided (well, being very much helped by this hack description for another
typewriter: https://hackaday.io/project/18506/instructions) to emulate
keyboard.

### The keyboard

They are 2 keyboards connectors, each with 10 pins. A keyboard is basically a
matrix of switches. To test it for example, by jumping pin 4 from left
connector to pin 0 of right connector, the typewriter will print an 'e' (and
repeat if you leave to jumper wire).

So first thing to do is to map all the key to their corresponding pins couple.
To do that, it could be as simple as using the continuity tester function of a
multimeter, connecting it to one pin of each connector then trying all key
until it beeps.

At the end, we got this marvelous table for the KX-R191

```

|   6 | 8   | 7     | i         | u   | l        | ö   |     | .     | -     | Tab+           |
|   7 | 9   | 0     | o         | p   | CapsLock |     |     | y     | x     | Code           |
|   8 | ´   | ß     | +         | ü   | Return   | ä   |     | Shift |       | QuickEraseLine |
|   9 | ←   | Print | Backspace |     |          |     |     |       | Reloc | ↨              |
+-----+-----+-------+-----------+-----+----------+-----+-----+-------+-------+----------------+
```

For now on, I may refer to the left connector as the "column" connector, and
the right connector as the "row" connector.

### Emulating the keyboard

Once mapping is known, we got to emulate keyboard with all the connector pins.
The principle for guessing which keys are pressed is that the typewriter will
sequencially "select" a column and "look" if any row is enabled.

Electronically speaking, all pins from left connectors will be sequencially (in
decreasing order) temporary pulled down for 200µs and if one (or more) pin of
the right is also pulled down, it means that the key is pressed. 

So on the arduino side (function `void activate(...)`), if we want for example
to print an 'e' (row 0, col 3), we have to wait that pin 3 of left connector is
down, then we set pin 0 of right connector to `LOW` until pin 3 is `HIGH`
again, then we set pin 0 of right to `HIGH` again (else the typewriter will
think that we've also pressed an 'r').

`activate` function have a special case for letters that are on the same column
as shift as they are the only valid case of two keys of the same column pressed
together (the only other modifier key is Code and has no valid "partner" key in
its column).

### Arduino code

The Arduino code contains the mapping table, with the symbols coded via their
ISO-8859-1 decimal code. It reads characters from the serial line and stores
them by line. After a LF or CR is received or when 72 characters have been
received, the line is send to the typewriter character by character.

For each character, it will apply its "modifier" (i.e. shift/code, but also
dead keys such as accents), then the character itself via `activate` (actually
`activate` is called two times to support 2 cycles, for better detection).

At the end of line printing, a `'.'` is send over the serial line to control
the flow. The client must wait this signal before sending next line. That's
what is done is ``print.py``.

### Python code

The python `print.py` is the computer-side of the project. It handles multiple
things:
 
- Initialize serial connection with correct parameters
- Read standard input and send lines to the typewriter
- Encode to ISO-8859-1
- Handle flow control mechanism

### What it looks like at the end

## Utilisation

### Arduino

Use an arduino with enough digital pins such as the Arduino Mega 2560. 

- Connect all the 10 pins of the left connector to the arduino (although the 6
  is useless and can be omited)
- Connect all the pins *except* 5 (caps lock led) and 4 (connect it the the
  ground) to the arduino

Set the correct pin mapping in the `get_col_pin` and `get_row_pin` function of
the code.

Then `make && make upload` and you're in business.

### Python

The only requirements for python is `pyserial`, install it system-wide or in a
virtualenv.

Then run `python3 print.py --help` to see all options.
